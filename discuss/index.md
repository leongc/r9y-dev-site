If a meeting is now in session, you can <a href="//meet.google.com/kdk-hnmf-yjp" class="btn btn--info">Join with Google Meet</a>

## About
This group brings together operations and development engineers from different organizations to discuss challenges and solutions around engineering for reliability. Share successes and failures, learn about best practices, and meet others who are also on a journey to implement a sustainable practice of reliability engineering.

## Format
* Monthly sessions via Google Meet -- all are welcome!
* We use a [Lean Coffee](https://www.youtube.com/embed/2kLkRqv1-Wc) format where discussion topics are generated by the group

*Also, [the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/reliability-discuss) is available any time for asynchronous discussion.*

## Topics
This conversation is what you choose it to be! Participants are welcome to to propose any topic, and whatever gets votes will be discussed. Of course, it is a reliability group, so here are some typical topic areas:

  * Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) and other approaches to building and maintaining reliable systems
  * Monitoring, observability, and incident response
  * Toil: identifying and reducing it
  * Service Level Indicators and Objectives (SLIs/SLOs)
  * Culture change, blamelessness, communication
